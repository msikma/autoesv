### `autoesv`

Moves `.pk6` and `.pk7` files to subdirectories based on their ESV. It's meant to be used for organizing eggs for [shiny hatching](https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/).

This is a very basic script that *only* copies files around for convenience in e.g. egg giveaways.

Run `./autoesv.py --help` for usage information. This script has no third party dependencies.

#### Example

My recommendation is that you make a directory called 'in' and put all your `.pk6` and `.pk7` files in there. Then make an empty directory called 'out'. This way you can just run `./autoesv.py ./in ./out` and it will organize all your egg files into the 'out' directory.

Here's an example of how that would work:

The image above shows a terminal running the program. It displays some basic information about the files it processes, and after it's done they are copied into the 'out' directory, organized in subdirectories. The subdirectory name is the ESV that will hatch the egg as a shiny.

As you can see, the eggs have been copied to subdirectories by ESV.
